üè® JSON Syntax Debugging: Hotel Booking Data
===========================================

üéØ Objective:
Students will analyze a JSON file containing multiple syntax errors,
identify the issues, and correct them.

This activity helps practice spotting and fixing common JSON mistakes such as:
- Missing commas
- Incorrect use of quotation marks
- Unmatched brackets/braces
- Trailing commas
- Invalid data types

// ============================================

/*
üìò Scenario:
You‚Äôre a developer on a team building a travel booking API.

A teammate submitted a JSON file to represent a hotel booking, 
but it contains multiple syntax errors that prevent it from being parsed.

üîß Your Task:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Review the provided JSON file
2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify all syntax errors
3Ô∏è‚É£ Write down what each error is and why it causes a problem
4Ô∏è‚É£ Correct the JSON structure so that it is valid
5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate your corrected version using a JSON linter or validator

üß™ Deliverables:
- A corrected version of the JSON
- A list of the corrections made and why each was necessary

// ============================================
// üîç Provided JSON File with Errors
// ============================================

const invalidBookingJSON = 
{
  "hotelName": "Grand City Hotel",
  "checkInDate": "2024-05-15",
  //Missing comma above
  "checkOutDate": "2024-05-20",
  "guests": [
    {
      "name": "Alice Johnson",
      //Missing quotes for the key name
      "age": 30,
      "email": "alice.johnson@example.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Bob Smith",
      "age": null,
      // fixing the undefined value of age to null
      "email": "bob.smith@example"
    }
  ],
  "roomDetails": {
    "type": "Suite",
    "pricePerNight": 200,
    // Fixing the trailing comma at the end of value Parking in the below array
    "amenities": ["WiFi", "Breakfast", "Parking"]
  }
};


// ============================================
// ‚úÖ Requirements
// ============================================

/*
- Use a JSON validator or linter (e.g., https://jsonlint.com/) to test your final version
- Keep track of each fix:
  ‚Ä¢ What was wrong?
  ‚Ä¢ Why is it a problem in JSON?
  ‚Ä¢ What did you change to fix it?
*/

// ü§î Follow-Up Questions
// ============================================

/*
üí¨ Reflect and answer the following:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What tools or techniques did you use to identify the errors?

I removed the template literals that commented the JSON object. VScode code linter helped me identify some errors.
Upon careful observation I was able to locate the other syntax errors and fix them.

2Ô∏è‚É£ How did you confirm that your corrected JSON file was valid?

I uploaded the original file to JSONLint online validator. It located the same errors that I was able to identify using VSCode.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Which errors were the most difficult to spot? Why?

Missing braces or brackets, missing quotes and trailing commas are a tad bit hard to identify. As we tend to focus on organizing and structuring the data, we may overlook these tiny details.

4Ô∏è‚É£ What strategies can help you avoid these kinds of errors in the future?
   (e.g., syntax highlighting, linters, writing JSON by example)

   * Using code linters like Prettier
   * Using Online JSON validators.
